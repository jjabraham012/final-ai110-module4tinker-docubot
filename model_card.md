# DocuBot Model Card

Filled in for the reference **solution**. Retrieval is implemented, documents are
chunked into paragraphs, and a refusal guardrail is in place. It is honest about
where a keyword-only retriever falls short.

---

## 1. System Overview

**What is DocuBot trying to do?**
DocuBot answers developer questions about a project by searching its documentation
(`docs/`) and, optionally, using an LLM to phrase an answer grounded in what it finds.
It exists to show the difference between generating from training data and generating
from retrieved evidence.

**What inputs does DocuBot take?** A user question, the Markdown/text files in `docs/`,
and (for Mode 3) a `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`.

**What outputs does DocuBot produce?** Either raw retrieved snippets with their source
filenames (Mode 2), an LLM answer grounded in those snippets (Mode 3), or an ungrounded
LLM answer (Mode 1). When nothing relevant is found, it returns
"I do not know based on these docs."

---

## 2. Retrieval Design

**How does retrieval work?**
- **Index:** `build_index` builds an inverted index (token → list of files).
- **Chunking:** each document is split into paragraph-sized chunks (`_build_chunks`),
  so retrieval can return one focused section instead of a whole file.
- **Scoring:** `score_document` drops stopwords (including corpus-meta words like "docs")
  from the query, then counts how many remaining query words appear as whole tokens in a
  chunk.
- **Selection:** `retrieve` scores every chunk, sorts descending, and returns the top 3 —
  unless the best chunk scores below the confidence threshold, in which case it returns
  nothing (a refusal).

**Tradeoffs:** Whole-token matching is precise but misses word variants ("connect" vs
"connection", "database" vs "database_url"). Paragraph chunks improve focus but can split a
heading away from the table it introduces. Simplicity was chosen over accuracy on purpose.

## 3. Use of the LLM (Gemini)

- **Naive LLM mode:** answers from training data only, ignoring the docs — a pure
  hallucination baseline.
- **Retrieval only mode:** no LLM; returns the retrieved snippets verbatim.
- **RAG mode:** retrieves snippets first, then asks Gemini to answer using only those
  snippets and to refuse when they're insufficient.

**Grounding instructions:** the RAG prompt in `llm_client.py` tells the model to use only
the provided snippets and to say "I do not know" rather than guess.

## 4. Experiments and Comparisons

Same queries, all three modes (Modes 1/3 require a Gemini key; observations below are from
Mode 2 retrieval plus expected LLM behavior):

| Query | Naive LLM | Retrieval only | RAG | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------------|-----|-------|
| Where is the auth token generated? | Plausible but unverifiable | Returns the AUTH.md token section | Grounded + readable | Retrieval nails this one |
| How do I connect to the database? | Generic advice | Returns SETUP.md, not DATABASE.md | Only as good as retrieval | Whole-token miss: "database_url" ≠ "database" |
| Which endpoint lists all users? | May invent a path | Returns the correct API_REFERENCE.md route | Best of the three | Clear RAG win |
| Is there any mention of payment processing? | Might hallucinate a feature | **Refuses** | **Refuses** | Guardrail working as intended |

**Patterns:** Mode 1 is fluent but ungrounded — dangerous when it invents specifics. Mode 2
is trustworthy but raw. Mode 3 is best when retrieval is right, and *inherits retrieval's
mistakes* when it's wrong.

## 5. Failure Cases and Guardrails

**Failure case 1 — "How do I connect to the database?"** Retrieval returns SETUP.md instead
of DATABASE.md, because the DATABASE doc says "connection" and "DATABASE_URL" — neither is a
whole-token match for "connect"/"database". A stemming or substring match would fix it.

**Failure case 2 — "How does a client refresh an access token?"** Retrieval returns
API_REFERENCE.md (which documents `POST /api/refresh`) rather than AUTH.md's refresh
narrative. Both are arguably relevant; the ranking just favors the endpoint doc.

**When DocuBot should refuse:** (1) when the question is about something not in the docs at
all (payment processing); (2) when no chunk shares a meaningful keyword with the question.

**Guardrail:** if the top-scoring chunk doesn't clear the confidence threshold, `retrieve`
returns an empty list and every answer mode replies "I do not know based on these docs."

## 6. Limitations and Future Improvements

**Limitations**
1. Keyword matching has no understanding of synonyms or word variants.
2. Paragraph chunking can separate a heading from the content it labels.
3. The corpus is tiny and fictional; scores don't reflect real-world scale.

**Future improvements**
1. Add stemming/lemmatization or substring matching to catch word variants.
2. Weight by term frequency (TF-IDF) instead of presence counts.
3. Rank by document-level relevance before selecting chunks, to avoid one verbose file
   crowding the top results.

## 7. Responsible Use

**Where could this cause harm?** A confident but wrong answer about auth or database config
could send a developer down the wrong path; a naive-mode hallucination could invent an
endpoint or env var that doesn't exist.

**Guidelines for real developers:**
- Treat Mode 1 (no retrieval) answers as unverified guesses.
- Always check the cited source file before acting on an answer.
- Prefer a clear "I do not know" over a plausible guess — the guardrail exists for a reason.
